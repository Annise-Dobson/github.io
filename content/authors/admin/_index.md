My research focuses on restoring and maintaining ecosystem resilience, health, and function. Based in community ecology, I examine interactions within above and below ground food webs consisting of native and non-native species. Using ecosystem ecology, I evaluate these management strategies to confirm they meet conservation goals, such as restoring ecosystem services. I focus both on regionally problematic invasive plants and pheretimoid earthworms across North America. I promote collaborative efforts among scientists, land managers, policymakers, and the public in biocontrol projects, emphasizing the importance of involving both stakeholders and Land Rights' holders in decision-making.
