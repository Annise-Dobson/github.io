Phenotypic plasticity enables a single genotype to produce varied phenotypes in different environments, helping individuals and populations adapt to environmental changes. This plasticity varies, even within a species, in response to similar stressors [(Rosenblatt et al. 2019)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecy.2643). Our research investigates the diverse plasticity forms in animals and their effects on ecosystems over space and time. This is crucial for understanding animal responses to climate change and their broader ecosystem impacts..
